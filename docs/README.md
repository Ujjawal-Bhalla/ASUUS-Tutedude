## Current Documentation

- **LOGIN_CREDENTIALS.txt**: Test account credentials for development
- **PRODUCT_IMAGES_LIST.txt**: List of all products in the system

## Archived Files

The `archive/` directory contains old documentation files that have been superseded by the main GUIDE.md:

- Old setup guides
- Deployment guides
- Status reports
- Troubleshooting guides
- Test scripts

These files are kept for reference but are no longer maintained.
